# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

This project involves the classification of Iris flowers into three distinct species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Using the famous Iris dataset, the goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

*DATASET*

Dataset is took from kaggle that is,
[Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)

The Iris dataset includes:

- 150 samples
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
Each class contains 50 samples. The dataset is well-balanced and widely used for testing machine learning algorithms.

## MODELS

Several machine learning models are implemented and compared, including:
1. Decision Tree
2. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes

## Results
The classification models achieve high accuracy on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for this task. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebooks.
